Name: Charity Water

----

Intro: The annual Berliner Wasserbetriebe Team Staffel relay race has become a platform for a group of runners from various sectors of society to raise funds for a campaign addressing the global water crisis.

----

Text: The runners activate friends, family and colleagues to sponsor them. The donations go towards charity:water, an innovative non-profit organisation based in New York that brings clean and safe drinking water to people in developing countries. Since 2011, the charity:water annual relay race has raised $35.249 (â‚¬26.706) for clean water projects serving 1.175 people in rural Ethiopian communities. Every year, we see more volunteers joining the run for this cause.
